# Trailblazers-Connect

This is my Non-Exam Assessment Project for AQA A-Level Computer Science

Trailblazers Connect is an Android Application for use by the Fremington Trailblazers running club         
<br>

Users are split up into 2 roles, "Runner" by default and "Coach":
* Runners are able to only view events that have been created
* Coaches are able to create events and add them to the calendar
<br>

Each event has a set of properties that are filled in when created by a coach:
* Title
* Details
* Location
* Date
* Time
* Which coloured groups the event is intended for
