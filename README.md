Trailblazers Connect is an Android Application for use by my local running club.

It synchronises an events calendar between all the users so that members can see when there next training session is.    

## User roles
### Runner
Runners are able to only view events that have been created, all new members are added to this role by default
### Coach
Coaches are able to create events and add them to the calendar, an admin can set any user to a coach in the backend
<br>

## Event attributes
* Title
* Details
* Location
* Date
* Time
* Which coloured groups the event is intended for
<br>

*This was my Non-Exam Assessment Project for AQA A-Level Computer Science*
